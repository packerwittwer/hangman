## Overview

**Project Title**: Hangman

**Project Description**: A simple hangman game where you have to guess the right letters before too many wrong guesses.

**Project Goals**: Create basic functionality of hangman using C++.

## Instructions for Build and Use

Steps to build and/or run the software:

1. I'm not sure if the exe will run on another machine, but if it will you should just need to run the hangman.exe file.
2. The words.txt file must be there as well.

Instructions for using the software:

1. Run hangman.exe
2. Guess letters how you normally would.

## Development Environment 

To recreate the development environment, you need the following software and/or libraries with the specified versions:

* You'll probably need to download the latest MinGW, that should give you all the libraries you'll need.
* My current version is g++ (MinGW.org GCC-6.3.0-1) 6.3.0

## Future Work

The following items I plan to fix, improve, and/or add to this project in the future:

* [1] Draw one arm/leg at a time, instead of drawing the guy one line at a time. 
* [2] Have a much larger words list to pull from, these were just some random words to make sure it worked.
* [3] Maybe add a category option where you can choose to guess from foods, or cities, or animals, etc.
